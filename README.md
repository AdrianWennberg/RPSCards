RPSCards

A simple card game that will be built in Unity and has aspirations to be a great cross platform, online two-player game. The game engine is built using .NEt Core and all game ideas and assets are designed by me, Adrian Wennberg. To follow along with the development, you can folow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AdrianWennberg) or follow my [blog](https://adrianwennberg.wordpress.com). 

I would be very grateful for any feedback, tips and ideas.
